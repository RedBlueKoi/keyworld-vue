# Recommended extensions for VSCode

Here is a list of extensions I am using personally. It is opinionated and if you already have your preferences you can skip it. But if you are a very beginner it is advised to install following:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)
- [Vue Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.vue-vscode-snippets)
- [TS Vue plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin)
- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
- [HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)
- [Indent Rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)
- [Inline Parameters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RichardLuo.inline-parameters)
- [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion)
- [Langauge Postcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cpylua.language-postcss) / [Postcss Language Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csstools.postcss) (I have both and you probably will be fine just installing the latter)
- [NPM IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.npm-intellisense)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Tailwindcss IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)
- [TODO tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)

I am also currently testing [Inline Bookmarks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tintinweb.vscode-inline-bookmarks), but I've installed it really recently so I will not put it on the main list. It is basically enhanced `TODO tree`. So yeah, if you are interested and want to install it I would actually be happy to hear a feedback from you.
