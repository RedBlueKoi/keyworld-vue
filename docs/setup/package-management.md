# Package management

This day it is very common that you might want to use packages from other people to use on your project. Packages like `Vue` or `Tailwindcss` for example. Instead of going to their `GitHub` repo now we simply can grab required packages from `NPM` manager.

You can install a package to your project with:

- `pnpm add package-name`
- `pnpm install package-name`
- `npm install package-name`

You can install a specific version of a package to your project with:

- `pnpm add package-name@version`
- `pnpm install package-name@version`
- `npm install package-name@version`

You can remove a package from your project with:

- `pnpm remove package-name`
- `pnpm uninstall package-name`
- `npm uninstall package-name`

You can list installed packages with `pnpm list` or `npm list`

You can update packages by running:

- `pnpm update`
- `npm update`
