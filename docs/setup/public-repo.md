# Public repo workflow

Work with public repo is not that different. The main difference comes to the fact that you are not included as contributor, which means that you cannot push branches to the origin of main repo.

To contribute to the repo where you are not included as contributor, you have to "fork" it. You can find the fork button on the top right of the page.

It is a common practice in working with public repos. At this point all is left to do is to clone your forked repo to your computer. To do so you need to install git. You can find information on how to install it for your specific system [here](https://git-scm.com/).

After that the process is similar to your own repo, except creating a PR - you want to point your PR not to your repo, but to the main repo you want to contribute to.
